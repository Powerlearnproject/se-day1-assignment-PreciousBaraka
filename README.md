#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The Birth of Software Engineering (1968) – The term was first used in the NATO Software Engineering Conference to address the "software crisis" caused by inefficient development processes.
The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s-1990s) – The introduction of OOP (e.g., Java, C++) improved code reuse, modularity, and maintainability.
Agile Methodology Emerges (2001) – The Agile Manifesto introduced a flexible, iterative approach to software development, revolutionizing how teams collaborate and deliver software.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirement Analysis – Gathering and defining system requirements.
Planning – Defining project scope, timelines, and resources.
Design – Creating system architecture and design specifications.
Implementation (Coding) – Writing the actual code.
Testing – Identifying and fixing software defects.
Deployment – Releasing the software to users.
Maintenance – Updating and improving the software after release.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase of development—such as requirement analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance—is completed before moving to the next. Once a phase is finished, revisiting it is difficult and costly.

Key Characteristics of Waterfall:

Clearly defined requirements at the beginning.
Extensive documentation and structured processes.
Minimal customer involvement after the initial planning stage.
Testing is conducted only after the development phase is complete.
When to Use Waterfall:
Waterfall is ideal for projects where requirements are well-defined and unlikely to change. For example, in industries like healthcare and banking, regulatory compliance and documentation are crucial, making Waterfall a suitable choice. A hospital management system or a government tax processing software would benefit from this method, as changes mid-development could cause delays and compliance issues.

Agile Methodology
Agile, in contrast, is an iterative and flexible approach that allows continuous feedback, adaptation, and collaboration. Development occurs in small increments called "sprints," where teams regularly reassess requirements and priorities.

Key Characteristics of Agile:

Encourages collaboration between developers, stakeholders, and customers.
Changes and new features can be introduced at any stage.
Frequent testing and releases improve software quality.
Less emphasis on documentation, more focus on working software.
When to Use Agile:
Agile is best suited for projects where requirements are dynamic and user feedback is essential. For example, a mobile app startup launching a social media platform would benefit from Agile, as user needs and market trends can evolve rapidly. Similarly, an e-commerce website undergoing continuous feature updates would thrive under Agile’s adaptability.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer – Writes code, debugs, and implements software features.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer – Tests software to identify and fix defects.
Project Manager – Oversees project timelines, resources, and team coordination.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
ntegrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Provide tools for writing, testing, and debugging code.
Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.
Version Control Systems (VCS)

Help track code changes and collaborate with teams.
Examples: Git, SVN, Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight Deadlines → Use Agile to break tasks into manageable sprints.
Debugging Complex Code → Utilize debugging tools and unit tests.
Keeping Up with Technology → Engage in continuous learning (courses, blogs, open-source projects).
Communication Gaps → Foster collaboration using tools like Slack, Jira, or Trello.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing – Tests individual components or functions (e.g., testing a login function).
Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together (e.g., database and frontend interactions).
System Testing – Tests the entire application as a whole.
Acceptance Testing – Confirms the software meets user expectations before release.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of designing effective input prompts to optimize the performance of AI models. It helps users get accurate, relevant, and well-structured responses from AI systems.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt:
"Tell me about cars."

Improved Prompt:
"Explain the differences between electric and gasoline-powered cars, including their environmental impact and cost of ownership."

Why the Improved Prompt is Better?

More specific – Focuses on electric vs. gasoline cars.
Clear scope – Includes environmental impact and cost.
Concise yet detailed – Avoids unnecessary vagueness.
